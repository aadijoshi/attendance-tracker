# User Manual
### Basics
To start using the app, you will need two things: install iOS app, and be able to login into the web-interface.

### iOS app usage
iOS app consists of three main interfaces:
*Create/edit tasks and swipe cards
*List of events
*Sync with the server

The usual workflow is the following:
*Create event (give it a name, specify a date)
*Swipe participants
*When you have internet connection, hit Sync button. This will erase events from the phone to prevent cluttering, and sync the events to the server so the analytics can be performed

### Web-interface usage
Web interface provides analytics and admin capabilities

#### Analytics
In order to perfrom analytics please do the following:
*Login into the web-interface
*All the events for the current semester will be loaded
*(optional) Change the time span to pull events (this will reload the events)
*Filter the events by name to get more detailed statistics
*The graphs at the top of the page refer to all events currently matching the specified time and filtering options
*Click on each individual event to see the specific statistics

### Admin
To access admin interface, please go to address-of-the-web-interface/admin
